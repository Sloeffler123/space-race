The problem was resolved, and EURECA was successfully boosted to its operational orbit on the mission's sixth day. TSS deployment also was delayed one day because of the problems with EURECA. During deployment, the satellite reached a maximum distance of only 860 feet from the orbiter instead of the planned 12.5 miles because of a jammed tether line.

Its initial orbit was more elliptical than intended, with apogee and perigee distances of about 45 and 25 earth radii. Its eccentricity decreased after launch. Its orbital inclination varied between 0 deg and about 55 deg with a periodicity of several years. The spacecraft spin axis was normal to the ecliptic plane, and the spin rate was 23 rpm. The data telemetry rate was 1600 bps. The spacecraft was in the solar wind for 7 to 8 days of every 12.5 day orbit.

The objectives of the extended IMP-8 operations were to provide solar wind parameters as input for magnetospheric studies and as a 1-AU baseline for deep space studies, and to continue solar cycle variation studies with a single set of well-calibrated and understood instruments.
In October, 2001, IMP 8 was terminated as an independent mission. Telemetry acquisition resumed after about three months at Canberra only (30-50% coverage), as an adjunct to the Voyager and Ulysses missions.

It carried seven experiments: a thermal ion experiment, a thermal electron experiment, an electrostatic probe, an electron temperature probe, a spherical mass spectrometer, an energetic electron current monitor, and a magnetic ion-mass spectrometer. Since the spacecraft had no tape recorder, data could be observed at the spacecraft only when the spacecraft was in sight of the telemetry station and when commanded on. Experiments were operated either simultaneously or sequentially, as desired.
Satellite performance was satisfactory except for a partial power failure in May 1966, which reduced data acquisition time to about half the nominal amount. Some difficulties were encountered in obtaining attitude information that was necessary for the reduction of the experiment observations. On July 1, 1969, the satellite data observations were terminated with five of the seven experiments operating. Responsibility for standby monitoring of the satellite was given to the ESSA telemetry station at Boulder, Colorado, on July 8, 1969. During this standby operation, experiment data were collected only once on October 1, 1969, for 9 min from the electrostatic probe for use in studying a red arc event.

Radio communication was provided by a 1 W, 108.03 MHz telemetry transmitter and a 10 mW, 108 MHz beacon transmitter that sent a continuous signal for tracking purposes.","Due to a malfunction of the ground control system, the duration of the second stage burn was incorrect, and it missed the moon by 5,995 kilometers, becoming the first man-made object to escape Earth.",The first communications satellite launch and the only orbital launch of Atlas B.,Maiden flight of Juno II. Premature first stage cutoff and erroneous angle during orbital insertion resulted in failure to reach orbit. Catalogued despite being on a suborbital trajectory. Returned data on radiation between the Earth and Moon.,"245 seconds into flight a hydrogen peroxide pump seized up due to loss of lubrication, which caused the rocket's core stage engines to fail.",The third stage failed to ignite.,A structural failure occurred on the final flight of Juno I.,"Broke up on ascent from longitudinal vibrations again, this time at T+104 seconds.","The third stage underperformed and Pioneer 1 failed to reach the Moon. However, the spacecraft was still able to transmit data on radiation between the Earth and Moon. It was the first NASA launch.",Second stage underperformed.,"First launch of the Vostok rocket, first Russian moonshot attempt. Failed at T+92 seconds for same reason as Sputnik-3 (vibrations in strap-ons).",One of the two second-stage engines failed to ignite. Final flight of NOTS-EV-1.,Failed to ignite.,Exploded during first stage ignition.,Loss of control after recontact between the first and second stages.,Unexpected loss of signal during ascent.,The maiden flight of Thor-Able I exploded at an altitude of 16 kilometers (9.9 mi).,Exploded during first stage ignition.,"Explorer 4 was instrumented by Dr. James van Allen's group. The Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency had initially planned two satellites for the purposes of studying the Van Allen radiation belts and the effects of nuclear explosions upon these belts (and the Earth's magnetosphere in general), however, Explorer 4 was the only such satellite launched as the other, Explorer 5, suffered launch failure.",Maiden flight of NOTS-EV-1. Unexpected loss of signal during ascent.,The 2nd stage lost thrust after only 8 seconds of burning due to fuel line obstruction.,A 2nd stage attitude control failure prevented the 3rd stage from entering the correct angle for orbital insertion.,Last launch of a Sputnik rocket.,Third stage failed to ignite.,"First flight of the upgraded version of Sputnik, 8A91. At T+90 seconds, abnormal vibrations originating from the strap-ons boosters were detected, followed by breakup of the vehicle 7 seconds later. First Soviet failure.","Explorer 3 was launched in conjunction with the International Geophysical Year (IGY) by the U.S. Army (Ordnance) into an eccentric orbit. The objective of this spacecraft was a continuation of experiments started with Explorer 1. The payload consisted of a cosmic ray counter (a Geiger-Müller tube), and a micrometeorite detector (a wire grid array and acoustic detector). The Explorer 3 spacecraft was spin-stabilized and had an onboard tape recorder to provide a complete radiation history for each orbit.",First successful Vanguard launch.,The fourth stage failed to ignite.,Loss of control 57 seconds after launch.,"Explorer 1 was the first spacecraft to detect the Van Allen radiation belt, returning data until its batteries were exhausted after nearly four months. It remained in orbit until 1970 and has been followed by more than 90 scientific spacecraft in the Explorer series.",The first orbital launch attempt by the United States. The rocket exploded on the pad after a loss of thrust.,"First crewed spacecraft (animals) in history, and second orbital flight in history. Laika (a dog) died from overheating prior to completion of experiments. The final flight of Sputnik-PS.","First ever human-made object to orbit the Earth, on a modified version of the R-7 ICBM.
First orbital launch of history, and first Soviet orbital launch.
First flight of Sputnik 8K71PS, and first orbital flight of R-7.
The Soviet Union becomes the first space power in history."
